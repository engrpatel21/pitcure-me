# Picture Me
Picture me was inspired by Instagram. I wanted to make a site where users can share their photos with other people.

## Future Plans
For the future I plan to add privacy features to the app. If the user sets their profile to private it will not show up on the main page. I also want to add in like and friends feature so that users are able to follow only the people they want to.
